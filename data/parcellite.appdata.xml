 <summary>Clipboard History Manager</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   Parcellite is an application that runs in the background and monitors the 
   clipboard(s), storing each copy in a list that can be chosen as the current entry later.
  </p>
  <p>
  This uses a hot key to pop up a history list. Clicking on an entry in the list will set that
  entry as the current clipboard selection. When the list is filled, it will start deleting the oldest
  entries. There is a persistent list that never goes away in addition to the normal history.
  Right-clicking on any of the entries in either list will allow you to move it to the other list. There are many settings
  on how to process text placed in the history (deleting whitespace, newlines, tabs, etc.). The entire history can be 
  saved to a file.
